# Training Piscine Python for datascience - 3 - Oriented Object Programming

## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python through a series of exercises inspired by the Game of Thrones universe. The goal is to create classes, manage inheritance, and utilize abstract classes to model characters and their relationships. This project emphasizes the importance of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

## Why is Relevant?
Hands-on experience with OOP concepts is crucial for developing robust software applications. This project provides practical skills in designing classes, managing inheritance, and implementing methods that enhance code reusability and organization. Understanding OOP is essential for any aspiring software developer or data scientist, as it allows for better structuring of complex systems.

## Skills
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Inheritance
- Abstract Classes
- Method Overriding
- Decorators

## Exercises
### Exercise 01: GOT S1E9 - Character Class
- **Description**: This exercise involves creating an abstract class `Character` with a method to change the health state of the character. The `Stark` class inherits from `Character`, allowing for the instantiation of character objects.
- **Relevance**: Understanding abstract classes and inheritance is fundamental in OOP, enabling the creation of flexible and reusable code structures.

### Exercise 02: GOT S1E7 - Family Classes
- **Description**: In this exercise, two families, `Baratheon` and `Lannister`, are created as subclasses of `Character`. The exercise also includes implementing `__str__` and `__repr__` methods for better string representation and a class method for character creation.
- **Relevance**: This exercise reinforces the concepts of inheritance and method overriding, showcasing how to create specialized classes that maintain a common interface.

### Exercise 03: Now Itâ€™s Weird! - King Class
- **Description**: This exercise introduces the `King` class, which inherits from both `Baratheon` and `Lannister`. Properties are used to manage the physical characteristics of the king, demonstrating multiple inheritance and property management.
- **Relevance**: Understanding multiple inheritance and property management is crucial for designing complex class structures that require shared attributes and behaviors.

### Exercise 04: Calculate My Vector - Calculator Class
- **Description**: This exercise involves creating a `calculator` class capable of performing vector calculations (addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division) with scalars. The class implements operator overloading for intuitive mathematical operations.
- **Relevance**: This exercise highlights the importance of operator overloading in Python, allowing for more natural and readable code when performing mathematical operations on custom objects.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable practical experience in object-oriented programming, emphasizing the importance of clean and efficient code design. Participants gain insights into OOP principles, enhancing their ability to develop scalable and maintainable software solutions.
